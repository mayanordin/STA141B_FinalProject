### **Code Notebooks**  
2. **`Generating_URLS_Indeed.ipynb`**  
   - Generates random combinations of URLs (job title, location, salary, mode of work).  
   - These URLs were used to scrape Indeed, ensuring a more diverse dataset.  

3. **`Merging.ipynb`**  
   - Merges, cleans, and adds new columns to the datasets.  
   - Includes code for generating all interactive plots featured in the report.  

4. **`Scraping_Indeed.ipynb`**  
   - Contains the code for web scraping job data from **Indeed**.  

5. **`Scraping_LinkedIn.ipynb`**  
   - Contains the code for web scraping job data from **LinkedIn**.
